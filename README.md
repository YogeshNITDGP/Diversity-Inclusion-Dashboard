# Diversity-Inclusion-Dashboard
## Problem Statement:
A leading telecom client approached PwC Switzerland's Human Resources advisory team for support in improving gender diversity at the executive management level. Despite ongoing efforts and initiatives, the client observed minimal progress in achieving a balanced gender representation across senior leadership roles.

To address this issue, the client sought a data-driven approach to uncover potential bottlenecks, biases, or blind spots in their current hiring, promotion, and performance evaluation processes. The goal was to identify key areas for improvement and define actionable KPIs to guide future diversity and inclusion strategies.

## Key Objectives:
1. Define relevant KPIs in the areas of hiring, promotions, performance ratings, and employee turnover with a specific focus on gender-based insights.
2. Visualize gender-related trends across key HR metrics using a clear T-visual format.
3. Identify root causes contributing to the lack of progress in female leadership representation.
4. Recommend strategic interventions backed by data to support a more inclusive and equitable workplace.
